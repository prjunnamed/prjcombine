# Virtex

Virtex is a family of SRAM-based FPGAs, the successor to XC4000 series.

There are five kinds of Virtex FPGAs:

- Virtex, the base version
  - Spartan-II, which is identical to Virtex
- Virtex-E, an upgraded version that adds differential inputs, some other IO changes, and more DLLs and BRAMs
  - Spartan-IIE, which is identical to Virtex-E, but has extra DLLs and BRAMs disabled in vendor toolchain
- Virtex-E Extended Memory, which adds even more BRAMs
