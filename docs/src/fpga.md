# FPGA grids and interconnect

This document describes the Project Combine model for FPGA tile grid structure and interconnect

The provided databases include an *interconnect database* for each target, which describes tile types, wire types, wire connections, and other objects that can be found in the devices.  An *expanded grid* structure describes how they are instantiated combined together within a given *device*.  Both *interconnect database* and *expanded grid* are target-independent structures.

Project Combine provides per-target Rust crates that construct an *expanded device* given the *device*.  The *expanded device* is a target-dependent structure that contains the *expanded grid* as one of its fields.


## The grid

An *expanded grid* is made of one or more *die*, which are identified by `DieId`.  The target-specific *chip* structure generally describes a particular model of a *die*.  A *die* is a 2D array of *cells*, organized in *columns* and *rows*.  A *cell* is identified by its `(DieId, ColId, RowId)` coordinates (known as `CellCoord`).  There is no requirement that the *die* within the device have the same dimensions.

The directions within a die are:

- *west*: towards smaller column index (usually to the left when displayed on screen)
- *east*: towards larger column index (usually to the right when displayed on screen)
- *south*: towards smaller row index (usually to the bottom when displayed on screen)
- *north*: towards larger row index (usually to the top when displayed on screen)

The directions are always relative to the silicon die, not the package.  Thus, for flip-chip packages, package left tends to be east.  Note that for multi-die devices the orientation of individual die may vary (ie. some of them may be rotated).


## FPGA interconnect — general principles and examples

Wires within an FPGA generally come in several kinds:

- local wires (contained within a single cell): used as inputs and outputs of bels, or intermediate multiplexer steps
- global or regional wires: connect all cells in the FPGA or in a region of an FPGA together, usually used for clocks or other high-fanout signals
- const-span wires: used to route signals between cells, going a fixed distance (for example, a "quad horizontal wire" would cover the distance of 4 cells horizontally)

Of these, const-span wires are the most complicated and dictate the design of the interconnect model.

### Example 1 — simple bidirectional quad wire

The first representative example (a horizontal quad wire) is shown below:

![Example device](wires-1-light.svg#light-only)
![Example device](wires-1-dark.svg#dark-only)

In the usual case, each wire in this example connects together 5 cells (thus covering a distance of 4 cells), and is made of five *segments*.  For example, the wire spanned between cells `X0Y0` and `X4Y0` has the following segments:

- `X0Y0_QUAD_H_0`
- `X1Y0_QUAD_H_1`
- `X2Y0_QUAD_H_2`
- `X3Y0_QUAD_H_3`
- `X4Y0_QUAD_H_4`

The wires cut off by the edge of the device are an exception, consisting of fewer segments:

- short wire ending at `X0Y0`:

  - `X0Y0_QUAD_H_4`

- short wire ending at `X1Y0`:

  - `X0Y0_QUAD_H_3`
  - `X1Y0_QUAD_H_4`

- short wire ending at `X2Y0`:

  - `X0Y0_QUAD_H_2`
  - `X1Y0_QUAD_H_3`
  - `X2Y0_QUAD_H_4`

- short wire ending at `X3Y0`:

  - `X0Y0_QUAD_H_1`
  - `X1Y0_QUAD_H_2`
  - `X2Y0_QUAD_H_3`
  - `X3Y0_QUAD_H_4`

In this example, each cell has an interconnect tile in it.  The interconnect tiles are uniform, and each tile can drive its corresponding `QUAD_H_0` and `QUAD_H_4` segments (or, in other words, a wire can be driven from both its ends, but not in the middle).  A common variant (seen on Virtex or iCE40) includes special interconnect tiles at the edges of the device, in which all wire segments can be driven.

In Project Combine (and, in fact, most toolchains), wires are identified by their "canonical" wire segment.  Which segment is considered canonical varies depending on the circumstances.  In this example, two (of many) reasonable rules would be:

- the westmost segment of the wire is the canonical one (usually `QUAD_H_0`, except when the wire is cut off by the west edge of the device)
- the `QUAD_H_2` (middle) segment is the canonical one, except when the wire is cut off by the west or east edge of the device, in which case the "closest" segment to `QUAD_H_2` is the canonical one (eg. `X0Y0_QUAD_H_3` would be canonical)

### Example 2 — quad wire with u-turns

A common variant of the above scheme includes "U-turns" at the edges, connecting together pairs of wires that would otherwise be cut off by the edge:

![Example device](wires-uturn-light.svg#light-only)
![Example device](wires-uturn-dark.svg#dark-only)

In this variant, the quad wires always have exactly 5 segments, though sometimes they revisit the same cells.  For example, one of the wires above consists of the following segments:

- `X2Y0_QUAD_H_4`
- `X1Y0_QUAD_H_3`
- `X0Y0_QUAD_H_2`
- `X0Y0_QUAD_H_3`
- `X1Y0_QUAD_H_4`

For cases like these, Project Combine chooses the middle segment (`QUAD_H_2` in this example) as the canonical one, as that leads to reasonably simple rules (each wire has exactly one `QUAD_H_2` segment, even if it involves a U-turn).

### Example 3 — directional quad-wire with u-turns

The above examples had wires that could be driven from both ends.  On newer and larger devices, the common practice is to use fixed-direction wires.  This is illustrated in the following example, which has independent east quad wires and west quad wires:

![Example device](wires-dir-light.svg#light-only)
![Example device](wires-dir-dark.svg#dark-only)

All wires here can be driven only at their `_0` segment.  This example also includes U-turns, which now turn `QUAD_W` wires onto `QUAD_E` wires (and the other way around at the east edge of the device).

When only one segment of the wire can be driven, Project Combine always chooses it as the canonical one by convention.

### Example 4 — regional wires

Regional wires are much simpler in principle: they involve connecting all wire segments of a given type together within some area.

Consider a simple (unrealistically small) 8×8 cell FPGA with 4 clock regions (corresponding to the four quadrants), with a single clock per region, driven from the center:

![Example device](wires-regional-light.svg#light-only)
![Example device](wires-regional-dark.svg#dark-only)

There are four clock wires, each consisting of 16 wire segments:

- `X3Y3_GCLK0` wire: `X[0-3]Y[0-3]_GCLK0` segments
- `X4Y3_GCLK0` wire: `X[4-7]Y[0-3]_GCLK0` segments
- `X3Y4_GCLK0` wire: `X[0-3]Y[4-7]_GCLK0` segments
- `X4Y4_GCLK0` wire: `X[4-7]Y[4-7]_GCLK0` segments

The usual convention is to consider the segment where the wire is driven (here: closest to center) as the canonical segment.


## Wires, wire segments, connectors — Project Combine model

In Project Combine, the interconnect database describes a number (usually between ~100 and ~1000) of *wire slots*, which are identified by `WireSlotId`.  A *wire segment* is uniquely identified by a tuple of `(CellCoord, WireSlotId)`, which is also known as `WireCoord`.  A *wire* is identified by the `WireCoord` of its canonical segment.

### Regions

Since the device may contain many kinds of regional wires with varying scopes, the interconnect database describes a number of *region slots*, identified by `RegionSlotId`.  Every regional wire slot is associated with such a region slot, and every cell of the expanded grid contains a mapping from `RegionSlotId` to a `CellCoord` where the canonical segment of all associated regional wires is located.  Thus, to describe [example 4](#example-4--regional-wires) above, one would allocate a single region slot, associate wire slot `GCLK0` with it, then store the following canonical coordinate for each cell:

- `X[0-3]Y[0-3]`: `X3Y3` is the canonical cell
- `X[4-7]Y[0-3]`: `X4Y3` is the canonical cell
- `X[0-3]Y[4-7]`: `X3Y4` is the canonical cell
- `X[4-7]Y[4-7]`: `X4Y4` is the canonical cell

### Connectors

For other kinds of wires, the connections between wire segments in (usually adjacent) cells are described by *connectors* and *connector classes*.

The interconnect database describes a small number of *connector slots*, identified by `ConnectorSlotId`.  For most databases, there are four connector slots, corresponding to the four directions, but some devices (such as versal) require more complex descriptions.

A *connector* in the grid is identified by a tuple of `(CellCoord, ConnectorSlotId)`, also known as a `ConnectorCoord`.  For each connector, the expanded grid has the following information:

- the *connector class* for this connector (`ConnectorClassId`), if any (`ConnectorCoord`s can be unfilled)
- optionally, *target cell* of the connector (`(ColId, RowId)`; the target cell is assumed to be within the same die)
  - connectors without a target cell are usually used at the die edges for U-turn purposes

Connector slots usually come in pairs, as do connectors themselves: if the cell `X0Y0` is connected to `X0Y1` via its `W` (west) connector slot, `X0Y1` must be connected to `X0Y0` via its `E` connector slot.

The connector itself merely describes the target of the connection; the details of the connection are described by the *connector class*.  The connector classes are listed in the interconnect database and identified by `ConnectorClassId`.  A connector class essentially describes how to map from a wire segment in the source cell to another wire segment in the target cell, such that the target wire segment is "closer" to the canonical segment.  To obtain the canonical segment of a given wire segment, one would repeatedly traverse connectors in sequence until the canonical segment (with no further mapping) is reached.

For a given wire segment, the connector class may have one of the following dispositions:

- none: the lookup ends here (this is the canonical segment), or connector slot not applicable to this wire segment
- *blackhole*: the wire segment is considered to be unusable, and should be disregarded because no wire exists to operate and only crimes are occuring (this is a rarely used disposition, created to deal with Virtex 5/6/7 long wire special cases)
- *reflect* to a given `WireSlotId`: this wire segment is connected to the given wire segment *in the same cell*; used for U-turns and such
- *pass* to a gien `WireSlotId`: this wire segment is connected to the given wire segment in the *target cell* of the connector

### Wire kinds

The interconnect database associates a name and a *kind* with each *wire slot*.  The wire kind is one of:

- *tie to 0* or *tie to 1*:
  - permanently driven to a given constant value
  - this segment is the canonical wire segment
  - no other segment can be driven
- *pullup tie*:
  - weakly driven to a const-1 value
  - generally identical to *tie to 1*, except for edge cases involving partial reconfiguration
- *regional*:
  - has an associated `RegionSlotId`
  - every *cell* in the *expanded grid* has a map from `RegionSlotId` to `CellCoord`; the canonical wire segment is the same `WireSlotId` at the given coordinates
  - used for clock networks and other cases where a wire is widely distributed in a way that's not easily described by the connector construct
- *mux output*:
  - this segment is the canonical wire segment
  - this segment is usually driven by a switchbox
  - no other segment can be driven
  - other segments of this wire, if any, will be of type *branch*
- *logic output*:
  - this segment is the canonical wire segment
  - this segment is usually driven by a proper bel
  - no other segment can be driven
  - other segments of this wire, if any, will be of type *branch*
- *test output*:
  - mostly like *logic output*, with the following differences:
  - the wire segment and any associated bel outputs are considered to be test-only (should not be used except when testing the device itself)
  - the output may not be routable without using special test muxes within interface logic
- *multi mux output*:
  - this segment is the canonical wire segment
  - this segment is driven by switchboxes
  - other segments can also be driven; they will be of type *multi branch*
- *branch*:
  - has an associated `ConnectorSlotId`
  - the canonical segment can be found by consulting the given connector at the current cell
  - the canonical segment will be a *mux output*, *logic output*, *test output*, or (usually around the edges of the die) *branch*
  - only the canonical segment can be driven
- *multi branch*:
  - has an associated `ConnectorSlotId`
  - the canonical segment can be found by consulting the given connector at the current cell
  - the canonical segment will be a *multi mux output* or *multi branch*
  - any segment can be driven

### Canonical wire algorithm

In addition to the *regional* wires and *connectors*, some targets have weird one-off connections that defy normal rules.  For these cases, the *expanded grid* has a last-resort `extra_conns` map of `WireCoord` to `WireCoord` describing the irregular connections.  Currently this map is used on the following targets:

- Virtex 7: for inter-die connections through the interposer (later Xilinx FPGAs use dedicated bels for such interconnections, instead of directly connecting wire segments)
- SiliconBlue iCE65 and iCE40: for connecting `QUAD.H` wires to `QUAD.V` wires at the corners, which is too irregular to be done by normal means

The complete algorithm for determining the canonical wire segment is:

1. If the current segment's kind is *branch* or *multi branch*:

   - obtain the connector from the current cell and the segment's `ConnectorSlotId` from the database
   - if no connector exists in this slot, proceed to step 3
   - look up the current segment's disposition within the connector's class in the database:
     - none: proceed to step 3
     - *blackhole*: the wire segment should be considered unusable and correspond to no wire; no mission can continue and all segments are surrendered to FBI
     - *reflect*: replace the current segment's `WireSlotId` with the one from the disposition, repeat step 1 with the newly obtained segment
     - *pass*: replace the current segment's `WireSlotId` with the one from the disposition, and replace `ColId` and `RowId` with the connector's target cell, repeat step 1 with the newly obtained segment; the *expanded grid* is considered ill-formed if the connector has no target cell but the class has *pass* dispositions

2. If the current segment's kind is *regional*: replace the current segment's cell with the one obtained by looking up the segment's `RegionSlotId` on the current cell; `WireSlotId` stays the same.

3. Look up the current segment in the *expanded grid*'s `extra_conns` map; if found, the result of the lookup is the canonical segment; otherwise, the current segment is the canonical segment.


## Tiles

A *tile* is a block of logic occupying some area on the grid.  A *tile* is defined by:

- its *tile class* (a `TileClassId`)
- its *anchor cell* (a `(DieId, ColId, RowId)`)
- its list of referenced cells (a list of `(ColId, RowId)`, indexed by `TileCellId`)
  - the anchor cell is generally included on this list, though not necessarily at the first position
  - the `DieId` of referenced cells is implicitly assumed to be the same as the anchor cell's

Every cell in an *expanded grid* contains a list of *tiles* for which it is an anchor cell.  A *tile* is identified by a tuple of `(DieId, ColId, RowId, TileClassId)`, known as a `TileCoord` (there cannot be more than one tile of the same class anchored at a given cell).

The contents of a tile are described by its *tile class*.  The interconnect database has the following information about each `TileClassId`:

- the name of the tile class
- the number of referenced cells (every tile of this class must have this amount of cells on its referenced cell list)
- interconnect muxes in the tile
- interface logic in the tile
- bels in the tile

Within the tile class description, wire segments are identified by `(TileCellId, WireSlotId)` tuples, also known as `TileClassWire`.  For a given tile, they can be translated to a `WireCoord` by using the tile anchor's `DieId` and looking up the `TileCellId` in the tile's referenced cells list to obtain `ColId` and `RowId`.

Grid *tiles* correspond directly to the bitstream concept with the same name — each tile class will usually have a corresponding entry in the bitstream database (the exception is tile classes that have no associated bitstream bits).  If this is the case, then every grid tile of this class will have an associated bitstream tile, and vice versa.  However, a target may have bitstream tile classes that do not correspond to grid tile classes — these are used to describe configurable logic outside of the interconnect grid, such as the special configuration logic registers on most targets.


### Interconnect muxes

The tile class definition contains a list of interconnect muxes present within the tile.  Each mux has:

- a destination wire segment (`TileClassWire`)
- a list of source wire segments (set of `TileClassWire`)
- a mux kind, one of:
  - non-inverting (the signal on the output is the same as the input)
  - inverting (the signal on the output is a complement of the input)
  - optionally-inverting (the mux can be programmed as inverting or non-inverting by the bitstream)

An interconnect mux can be programmed by the bitstream to drive any of its inputs on its output, or disabled.

A mux within a tile is identified by the destination `TileClassWire` — multiple muxes driving the same wire segment are not currently supported.  No other programmable connections between wires are supported either (except ones going through bels) — all pass gates, standalone buffers, and actual muxes that can drive a given wire segment are consolidated as a single virtual mux.

TODO: this model needs to be revisited:

- it could be more convenient to be able to represent multiple entities driving a given wire segment, as well as their kind (mux, buf, pass gate) — this would match the bitstream encoding
- it is not clear whether the fixed inversion should be an attribute of the mux, or of the mux input (no currently supported target uses inverting muxes in general interconnect)
- it is not clear whether the optional inversion should be included here or as part of the interface construct


### Interface logic

A tile may contain *interface logic*.

TODO: the current interface logic model is unfit for purpose, and should be replaced with something better.  The following is a rough sketch of what we *want* to represent.

*Interface logic* is all sort of circuitry that sits between general interconnect and a bel input or output.  This includes:

1. *Test muxes*, which are special muxes used only for testing the FPGA interconnect itself.  Test muxes are usually inserted between the bel outputs and the actual interconnect wire.  They have the following kinds of inputs:

   - the actual bel non-test output (at most one)
   - interconnect wires usually connected to bel inputs
   - bel test outputs

   A distinguishing feature of test muxes is they don't have independent input selection — there may be a shared bitstream field controlling the selection of all test muxes within a tile.  This tends to make them unusable outside of testing conditions.

2. Programmable input delay, generally found in front of bel input pins.  Used for hold time fixups.

3. Optional input registers, generally found in front of bel input pins.  Used for two purposes:

   - pipelining
   - hold time fixup


### Bels

A *bel* (basic element of logic) is a block of logic that is a part of a *tile* that is not representable as an interconnect mux nor interface logic.

Anything that can drive a signal onto general interconnect (ie. has an output pin) or sample a signal from general interconnect (ie. has an input pin) is considered a bel.  This includes ingress/egress points of clock and dedicated routing.  Additionally, pin-less bels may exist if deemed useful by the target for some reason.

Every target has a fixed list of *bel slots* that are availble in each cell.  The bel slots are identified by `BelSlotId`, and bels are identified by `(DieId, ColId, RowId, BelSlotId)` (also known as `BelCoord`).  The interconnect database has a name for every *BelSlotId*, which generally roughly identifies the type of bels occupying the slot (eg. a target where a cell can contain 8 logic cells or one blockRAM will have bel slots of `LC0` through `LC7` and `BRAM`).

Bels belong to tiles, and the bel's cell is considered to be the same as its tile's anchor cell.  An *expanded grid* is considered ill-formed if a given cell anchors more than one tile that contains a bel with a given `BelSlotId`.

A tile class definition has a list of contained bels.  For each bel it has:

- the occupied slot (`BelSlotId`; the slots are unique within a tile)
- a list of pins; for each pin:

  - pin name
  - pin direction (input or output)
  - for an input pin: the wire segment connected to the pin (`TileClassWire`)
  - for an output pin: list of wire segments connected to the pin (nonempty list of `TileClassWire`)



## General notes and scope

The generic FPGA grid and interconnect system described here is designed for the objects that would be subject to generic place and route.  Thus, it is only used to describe general interconnect and the actual FPGA grid.  In particular, the following features are considered out of scope and are (usually) handled by target-specific means instead:

1. Dedicated interconnect (connections between predefined bel pins that are not routable to/from the general interconnect) and any bel pins using only dedicated interconnect.  This includes:

   - carry or cascade chains of all sorts
     - if the carry chain can be sourced from the general interconnect at the start, or sunk into the general interconnect at the end, such entry / exit points are represented as special bels
   - direct connections to and from dedicated or semi-dedicated I/O pads, such as:
     - dedicated clock input pads
     - dedicated PLL input or output pads
     - designated I/O pads for a hard logic block, such as a memory controller, SPI or I²C controller, PCI logic, and so on
   - fixed connections between bels that can be "combined together" and used as a larger bel, such as:
     - wide mux connections between SLICEs
     - SLICEs that can be combined together to form a large LUT-RAM
     - two 18kbit blockRAMs that can be combined to form a 36kbit blockRAM

   From a placer's point of view, dedicated interconnect behaves like a placement constraint (as opposed to general interconnect, which imposes no placement constraints other than those implied by timing requirements).  From a router's point of view, dedicated interconnect should be handled by dedicated router, as the routing resources involved are independent from the bulk of work involved in general interconnect routing, and routing failures tend to result from violations of relatively simple constraints that can be communicated to the user.  Thus, there is no need to represent it in the same data structures.

2. Global / clock interconnect, except for the "last mile" where it enters the general interconnect muxes.

   Clock interconnect tends to have special properties:

   - is usually closely tied to clock enable / divider / multiplexer bels
   - has low-skew properties that make the usual "Euclidean distance" approximate metric inapplicable for timing
   - is scarce and should be allocated intentionally

   These properties usually make it inconvenient to handle clock interconnect by the same means as general interconnect.

3. Any sort of circuitry that's outside of the interconnect grid, except as needed to represent its connections to the general interconnect.

   This includes things such as:

   - the configuration logic, on targets where it doesn't have any routable pins
   - on hard SoC devices such as Zynq, any sort of CPU cores, peripherials, or dedicated I/O pads
   - the Virtex 7 GTZ transceivers
   - on Versal:
     - the NoC horizontal rows on the north and south edges of the device
     - XPIO banks and their associated logic
     - DDR and HBM memory controllers
     - the AI engine grid

   This sort of circuitry is exposed via target-specific means, as applicable.

Further, grid columns and rows are intended to correspond 1-to-1 with columns and rows of interconnect tiles (tiles containing general interconnect muxes).  This means:

- if the tile grid, as understood by vendor tools, has separate columns for interconnect and actual logic associated with that interconnect (such as later Xilinx FPGAs), we disregard this separation and treat both of those together as a single column
  - for the special case of Ultrascale and Versal, which have independent logic columns on both sides of an interconnect column, we treat each vendor interconnect column as *two* grid columns (so that bels on both sides gets separate X coordinates)
- any sort of special columns and rows (clock distribution, edge terminators, I/O buffers, ...) in between "normal" columns and rows or at the edges are not assigned their own grid coordinates; any sort of logic and wiring within is considered to be part of a nearby interconnect column or row:
  - for a special column in between two interconnect columns, the column to the east is used
  - for a special row in between two interconnect rows, the row to the north is used
  - for a special column or row at the edge, the outermost column or row in the given direction is used

The above rules aren't completely hard, and are mostly based on vibes and on how hard it would be to squash a given thing to match the grid model.
